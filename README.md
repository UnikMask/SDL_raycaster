# SDL_raycaster
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/UnikMask/SDL_raycaster.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/UnikMask/SDL_raycaster)

A library for raycasting using SDL as a graphic library

This is early into work in progress stage and is mainly built for fun.
Even after I finish it (if I do), I do not plan on keeping it maintained.
